<Default title={pageTitle} description={description}>
  <h2>This is my blog subsite</h2>
  <p>I run this just to tinker with the <a class="astro" href="https://astro.build" target="_blank">Astro</a> 🚀 framework.</p>
  <p>
    On this blog, I'll be posting notes and cheat sheets for myself, as well as reflecting some of my experiences that may be helpful to others.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other than blog, this website also has some other standalone pages with different content that I found interesting. Have fun 🫰
